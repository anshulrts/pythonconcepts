# The Python interpreter executes scripts starting at the top of the file,
# and there is no specific function that Python automatically executes like in other languages.

# Having a defined starting point for the execution of a program is useful for
# understanding how a program works. Python programmers have come up with several conventions
# to define this starting point.
